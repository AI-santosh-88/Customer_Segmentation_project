# Customer Segmentation Using K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering

### Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of 200 records with the following columns:

#### * CustomerID: 
                  A unique identifier for each customer.
#### * Gender: 
             The gender of the customer (Male/Female).
#### * Age: 
           The age of the customer.
#### * Annual Income (k$): 
                         The annual income of the customer in thousand dollars.
#### * Spending Score (1-100): 
                             A score assigned by the mall, based on customer spending behavior.


## Data Preprocessing
Before performing clustering, the following preprocessing steps were carried out:

#### * Selecting Relevant Features:
We focused on two columns: Annual Income (k$) and Spending Score (1-100) for clustering. These features are used to group customers based on their income and spending behavior.

#### * Handling Missing Values:
The dataset was checked for any missing or infinite values, and none were found.

#### * Standardization:
In this case, standardization was not necessary, as the features are already on a comparable scale.
